      "text": "Adrian Burkhalter launched the NGG (Next Generation Give & Grow) project as part of his work as a learning mentor at Swisscom. For seven years, he ran IT courses in collaboration with over 300 participating apprentices, from which over 500 asylum seekers benefited. After retiring, Adrian developed this idea further privately and so, after a few months of development work, the iSTEP association was founded in early summer 2023. The team now consists of 12 members. We also work together with various aid organizations."

The younger children spent the day with Nadine in the Creative Course, while the adults moved to the conservatory with Hanna for more sewing lessons. Further information on these two courses will be shared in the upcoming posts. The older children focused on the Scratch programming language. The children had independently learned the basics of Scratch over the summer, and our Albanian team members were available on Sunday evenings to answer their questions. This opportunity was well received, sparking engaging discussions and drawing interest from everyone present. To bring all the children up to speed, we conducted a refresher on the material covered.

Through his experiences, he has a very clear idea of what tourism could look like. He believes there is still room for improvement in Albania.

Sister Maggie (actually Margerita, but nobody really calls her that) shares a bit about her career, which brought her from northern India to Albania.
